      <p>The project was officially announced in May of 2006 [7] and was originally set in the era of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. This setting , however, was later dropped, with Blizzard feeling that it would be too similar to The Lord of the Rings [9] Initially set for a 2009 release, the film was later delayed to 2011 ,[10] However by Comicon 2011 the film was announced to still be in the "Treatment stage"".[11]</p>
      <p>Uwe Boll made a bid to direct, but was turned away by Blizzard, who he claims to have said, "We will not sell the movie rights, not to you… especially not to you. Because it’s such a big online game success, maybe a bad movie would destroy that ongoing income, what the company has with it."[12] Sam Raimi was initially attached to direct,[13][14] but was replaced by Duncan Jones in January 2013.[15] At San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2013, a concept trailer was presented, featuring a battle between a human and an orc.[16]</p>
      <p>On September 23, 2013, it was also reported that actors Paul Dano, Travis Fimmel, Anson Mount, and Anton Yelchin were on the shortlist for the film. In October 2013, Fimmel was announced to be the lead character.[17][18] On December 4, 2013, the main cast of the film, consisting of Fimmel, Ben Foster, Paula Patton, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell and Rob Kazinsky, was announced. On December 14, 2013, Universal added Daniel Wu and Clancy Brown to the cast of the film.[19] In early March 2014, newcomer Burkely Duffield joined the cast.[20] At a panel presentation during BlizzCon 2014, many of the casting announcements were made.</p>
      <p>Principal photography began on January 13, 2014 and lasted for four months, finishing on May 23, 2014.[21][22] Filming took place primarily in Vancouver among other locations.[23] Post-production lasted twenty months.[24] The film's visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, with over 1,000 visual effects shots taken. The ILM team took photographs and scans of the actors portraying orcs and integrated the images with concept art created by Blizzard's artists.[25] Regarding the use of computer-generated imagery, Duncan said, "It's a tool like any other. It can be done well and it can be done shit. The best CGI has you forgetting [that] it's CGI, and accepting the visual as whatever it is supposed to be—like props. No one has an issue with props in film, do they?"[26]</p>
